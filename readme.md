# Rust exercises

In this repo, I'm learning rust from scratch by solving problems from Leetcode, using the nightly rust version.

I have a few rules for this challenge:

- Avoid picking up problems that I've already completed with other languages.
- Try a bit of each topic.
- Solve it on my own first without looking at solutions.
- Keep the solutions readable and well documented.

## Problems:

### 1 - Arrays & Hashing

| Problem | Difficulty |
|---|---|
| [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/) | Easy |
| [Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/) | Easy |
| [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) | Easy |
| [Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/) | Medium |
| [Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/) | Medium |
