# Rust exercises

In this repo, I'm learning rust from scratch by solving problems from Leetcode, using the nightly rust version.

I have a few rules for this challenge:

- Avoid picking up problems that I've already completed with other languages.
- Try a bit of each topic.
- Solve it on my own without looking at solutions.
- Start with a simple solution to the problem then elaborate it a bit more and compare them where possible.
- Keep the solutions readable and well documented.

## Problems:

### 1 - Arrays & Hashing

| Problem | Difficulty |

| [Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/) | Easy |
